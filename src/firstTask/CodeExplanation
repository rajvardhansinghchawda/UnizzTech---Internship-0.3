### Java Currency Converter Code

This Java program is a simple currency converter that allows users to convert amounts between four predefined currencies: Rupee, Euro (EUR), British Pound (GBP), and US Dollar (USD). It consists of two classes:

1. **Main Class**:

   - Manages user input and interaction.
   - Collects the source and target currencies, and the amount to be converted.
   - Repeatedly prompts the user to perform conversions until they choose to exit.

2. **Convertor Class**:

   - Contains the conversion logic.
   - Uses predefined exchange rates based on the selected source currency.
   - Calculates and displays the converted amount in the target currency.

The exchange rates are hardcoded, and the program uses a `switch` statement for rate selection. The program provides a user-friendly console-based interface for currency conversion.
