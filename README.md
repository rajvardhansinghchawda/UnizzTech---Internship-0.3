# Currency Converter Application

## Overview

The Currency Converter is a Java application that allows users to convert amounts between four predefined currencies:

- Rupee (INR)
- Euro (EUR)
- British Pound (GBP)
- US Dollar (USD)

This project consists of two classes:

1. **`Main`**: Handles user interaction and program flow.
2. **`convertor`**: Implements the conversion logic.

## Features

- Interactive console-based user interface.
- Support for four currencies with hardcoded exchange rates.
- Option to perform multiple conversions in a single session.

## How It Works

1. The user is presented with a menu of currencies to choose from.
2. The user selects the source (`from`) and target (`to`) currencies by entering the corresponding menu numbers.
3. The user enters the amount to be converted.
4. The application calculates and displays the converted amount.
5. The user can choose to perform additional conversions or exit the application.

## Example Usage

### Input:

```
Welcome to the Currency Converter!
1. Rupee    2. Euro (EUR)    3. British Pound (GBP)    4. US Dollar (USD)
From Currency: 1 (Rupee)
To Currency: 4 (USD)
Amount: 500
```

### Output:

```
Rupee to USD is 6.0.
```
